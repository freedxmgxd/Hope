#### Propelente

* LASC

  * "Note that all propellants used must be non-toxic. Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP), potassium nitrate and sugar (aka "rocket candy"), nitrous oxide, liquid oxygen (LOX), hydrogen peroxide, kerosene, propane and similar substances, are all considered non-toxic. Toxic propellants are defined as those requiring breathing apparatus, special storage, transport infrastructure, extensive personal protective equipment, etc. (e.g. Hydrazine and N2O4)"

### Controle de vazão

* LASC
  * "Hybrid and liquid propulsion systems shall implement a means for remotely controlled venting or offloading of all liquid and gaseous propellants in the event of a launch abort."

#### Paraquedas

* LASC
  
  * "Each independently recovered launch vehicle body anticipated to reach an apogee above 1500 meters AGL shall follow a "dual-event" recovery operations concept (CONOPS), including an initial deployment event (e.g. a drogue parachute deployment; reefed main parachute deployment) and a main deployment event (e.g. a main parachute deployment; main parachute un-reefing)"

##### Paraquedas Drogue

* LASC
  * "The initial deployment event for dual-event recovery shall occur at or near apogee, stabilize the vehicle's attitude (i.e. prevent tumbling), and reduce its descent rate enough to permit the main deployment event yet not so much as to exacerbate wind drift (e.g. between 20-45 m/s)."

#### Paraquedas Principal

* LASC
  * "The main deployment event shall occur at an altitude no higher than 500 meters AGL and reduce the vehicle's descent rate sufficiently to prevent excessive damage upon impact with the ground (i.e. less than 10  m/s)."

#### Payload

* LASC
  * Dimensões: 10cm x 10cm x 30cm, baseado nas dimensões de 3 cubesats.
  * "4,000 grams of payload for 3,000 meters AGL apogee."
  * "If a functional payload is chosen, with the functional part itself not providing enough mass to reach the minimum requirements, additional dummy-masses may be added to the functional payload until the minimum mass requirement is reached."
  * "Payloads shall not contain significant quantities of lead or any other hazardous materials (e.g. radioactive materials). Finally, payloads shall not contain any live animals."
